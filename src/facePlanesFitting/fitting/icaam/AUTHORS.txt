Acknowledgments: 
Special thanks to Simon Baker for providing important implementation details and 
Jing Xiao for allowing me to look at his implementation of the shape from motion 
algorithm.
The annotation procedure was inspired by the one provided in Mikkel B. Stegmann's 
"AAM-API" implementation , while some other ideas were borrowed form Brian Amberg's 
"compositional descent" implementation.
